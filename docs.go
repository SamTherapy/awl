/*
awl is a DNS lookup tool written in Go,
similar to (and heavily inspired by) drill.

It runs and displays similar outputs to drill, without any frills.
Options are given to print with JSON

Supports results from DNS-over-[UDP, TCP, TLS, HTTPS, QUIC] servers

Why use this over the alternatives? Good question.
